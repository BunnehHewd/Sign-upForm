# Sign-upForm

### Introduction

My take on the Sign-up Form project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/intermediate-html-and-css-sign-up-form). 
Featured in this project is form and password validation. As an extra challenge, I pushed myself to focus on building a highly-reactive website. Try it out!
